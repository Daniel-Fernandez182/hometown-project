This is a little practice project I created to cement my understanding of some CSS and HTML concepts. I really like how it turned out and feel free to check it out whenever I host the website.

The website is just a simple webpage that describes a little bit about the hometown I grew up in. Maybe I will update it in the future to make it better, but I do like the simplicity as is.
